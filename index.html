   <pre>              <font size="3" face="helvetica">The internet is an fairly recent invention that has changed the world. In 1969 Arpanet was created, the first real 
network which used packet switching technology,its first message which was sent between the computers at Stanford and UCLA was the word "Login". <br/>Then a year later,
the Arpanet system was established between Harvard,MIT,and BBN. </font>    </pre>

    <pre> <font size="3" face="helvetica">In 1971 Ray Tomlinson developed the Email and made  the decision to use the "@" for the seperation of the username to the computer name.
    In 1973 Arpanet made its first Trans-Altantic-connection at London, and 75% of all the active network on Arpanet was used for email.  </font> </pre>

    <h3>1991-3, World Wide Web </h3>
<pre><font size="3" face="helvetica">The first Web page was created in 1991. Then in 1993, Mosaic a web browser released. 
This was important because it was the first browser that made the Internet easy for ordinary people to access. After the Mosaic was released, 
a year later Netscape Navigator was created, which competed with Mosaic. Also Netscape made online transactions secure which fueled the start of 
companies like Amazon.com,and eBay. After a few years later in 1998, Google was created, it changed how people found information online,
and we still use it to this day. </font></pre>

<pre><font size="3" face="helvetica"> CSS stands for cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to change a webpages appearance and structures.
 The best CSS for many changes to the appearance to your website is external CSS. The code for the external CSS might look like this.
<img src="https://bit.ly/2Fc0QoK" height="400px" >
	
	The reason why it is ideal for many webpages is because you can control the structure of the webpage. Using external CSS also gives you a much faster
	load time for your webpage. A example of a simple External CSS code to change the color of a background might look like this. 
	<font color="red">background-color: #RRGGBB</font> I have also learned that if you use the <font color="red"><xmp><div id="variable">*put code that you want affected by the CSS</div>   </xmp></font>
then go to your external CSS then and Create the code <font color="red"><xmp> #Variable {
 *changes to the variable
     }</xmp></font>
this will allow you to make extensive changes to the variable. I another CSS code that I have learned and has helped me is <font color="red"><xmp> float:*direction you want;</xmp></font>
This code will change the side of where you want your text to be. For example you can have headings on the left while normal text beside it. This is
how much CSS I've learned and it is basic, in the future I hope to learn more complicate CSS.

 <center> 
	<h1> <font size="7"><a href="#chapter4">HTML</a></font></h1></center> <a name="link2">
 <pre><font size="3" face="helvetica">
 	

 	HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a programming language that creates webpages on the World Wide Web. 
	The first lines you start with when you are creating your html webpage are
 	<font color="red">
 	<xmp> 
 	<html>
 	<head>
 		
 	</head>
 	<body>
 	
 	</body>
 	</html>
</xmp></font>
The html tag shows that it is html that we are using. The body tag contains all the webpages content. Some tags that I have learned are the <font color="red"><xmp><p>, <h1>,<hr/>,<font></xmp> </font>
	The paragraph tag is what you write your text in if you do not want it to be a header. The hr tage skips a line but puts in a horizontal line in it. 
	the Font tag is very useful because you can change your font to hundreds of different other fonts, you can also change the size of your text,and 
	the color can be changed using the font tag.
