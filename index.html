   <pre>              <font size="3" face="helvetica">The internet is an fairly recent invention that has changed the world. In 1969 Arpanet was created, the first real 
network which used packet switching technology,its first message which was sent between the computers at Stanford and UCLA was the word "Login". <br/>Then a year later,
the Arpanet system was established between Harvard,MIT,and BBN. </font>    </pre>

    <pre> <font size="3" face="helvetica">In 1971 Ray Tomlinson developed the Email and made  the decision to use the "@" for the seperation of the username to the computer name.
    In 1973 Arpanet made its first Trans-Altantic-connection at London, and 75% of all the active network on Arpanet was used for email.  </font> </pre>

    <h3>1991-3, World Wide Web </h3>
<pre><font size="3" face="helvetica">The first Web page was created in 1991. Then in 1993, Mosaic a web browser released. 
This was important because it was the first browser that made the Internet easy for ordinary people to access. After the Mosaic was released, 
a year later Netscape Navigator was created, which competed with Mosaic. Also Netscape made online transactions secure which fueled the start of 
companies like Amazon.com,and eBay. After a few years later in 1998, Google was created, it changed how people found information online,
and we still use it to this day. </font></pre>

<pre><font size="3" face="helvetica"> CSS stands for cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to change a webpages appearance and structures.
 The best CSS for many changes to the appearance to your website is external CSS. The code for the external CSS might look like this.
<img src="https://bit.ly/2Fc0QoK" height="400px" >
  
  The reason why it is ideal for many webpages is because you can control the structure of the webpage. Using external CSS also gives you a much faster
  load time for your webpage. A example of a simple External CSS code to change the color of a background might look like this. 
  <font color="red">background-color: #RRGGBB</font> I have also learned that if you use the <font color="red"><xmp><div id="variable">*put code that you want affected by the CSS</div>   </xmp></font>
then go to your external CSS then and Create the code <font color="red"><xmp> #Variable {
 *changes to the variable
     }</xmp></font>
this will allow you to make extensive changes to the variable. I another CSS code that I have learned and has helped me is <font color="red"><xmp> float:*direction you want;</xmp></font>
This code will change the side of where you want your text to be. For example you can have headings on the left while normal text beside it. This is
how much CSS I've learned and it is basic, in the future I hope to learn more complicate CSS.

  HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a programming language that creates webpages on the World Wide Web. 
  The first lines you start with when you are creating your html webpage are
  <font color="red">
  <xmp> 
  <html>
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
  
  </body>
  </html>
</xmp></font>
The html tag shows that it is html that we are using. The body tag contains all the webpages content. Some tags that I have learned are the <font color="red"><xmp><p>, <h1>,<hr/>,<font></xmp> </font>
  The paragraph tag is what you write your text in if you do not want it to be a header. The hr tage skips a line but puts in a horizontal line in it. 
  the Font tag is very useful because you can change your font to hundreds of different other fonts, you can also change the size of your text,and 
  the color can be changed using the font tag. The href tag is very useful because you can link images and bookmark things on your page with
  it. <xmp> <a href="*link">text</a>
  </xmp>

    Processing is the first programming language I've done. Processing starts off simple but can get intense in some areas.
    The very first thing I learn in processing was how to make a ellipse. The way to make this is to Identify what the object is then state the X, and Y. After 
    that you must state the width first, and then the height
     For Example:
     <img src="https://bit.ly/2IYaHjk" >

     The code structure for the rectangles is very similar to the ellipse except the first to numbers are the coordinates for the top left of the rectangle 
     not the center.The next thing I really enjoyed learning in Processing is motion. In motion you must first create global variables then Initialize it
      with how fast you want the xvel or yvel. After that you must update the variable.  The second thing I enjoyed doing are the parabolas. To do the 
      parabola's you must first graph a parabola and find the equation, after doing this you create a  new function and specify what your x will be 
      and write your code. A example of what a parabola would look like
      <a href="https://bit.ly/2XoGGlN">Here</a>

      The Next thing we did that I enjoyed was creating for loops. What for loops do is that they shorten the code that would have taken dozens of 
      line with just a couple lines of code They are useful because you can create patterns without it taken dozens of line to do. 
      code for for loop
      <xmp> for (int i = 0; i < 40; i = i+1) {

  line(30, i, 80, i);

}
</xmp>

          <font size="3" face="helvetica">Binary numbers are base 2 numbers, and have only two values,0 and 1.
If we look at a binary number like 101, then we can again assign column values as we did with our decimal number, but this time we use 2, and not 10 as the base.
<img src="https://bit.ly/2L1uWPx">
So binary 101 binary has 1 in the units column,0 in the 2s column and 1 in the 4s column.
Again if we work our way from right to left then:The 1 is a 1 as it is in the units column but the next 1 is not 1 but 1*4=4
<h3>Hexadecimal</h3>
Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system. That means there are 16 possible digits used to represent numbers.
 10 of the numerical values you're probably used to seeing in decimal numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; those values still represent 
 the same value you're used to. The remaining six digits are represented by A, B, C, D, E, and F, which map out to values of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
